4. **Public Announcement**: In cases where transparency is needed, a public statement may be issued to address the behavior and corrective actions taken.

## Appeals
In case of a ban or any disciplinary action, the banned party may appeal by submitting a written statement to yulianzavodnyk@gmail.com. The appeal will be reviewed by the project maintainers, and a final decision will be made based on the merits of the case. Repeated appeals with no new information will not be considered.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including but not limited to the GitHub repository, issue trackers, mailing lists, social media channels, and in-person or online events.
